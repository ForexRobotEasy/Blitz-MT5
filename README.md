# Blitz MT5 Expert Advisor

## Introduction
Blitz MT5 is an Expert Advisor (EA) developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This EA is designed to automate trading in the MetaTrader 5 platform. It utilizes a risk-based approach to determine lot size and sets predefined take profit and stop loss levels.

## Product Description
Blitz MT5 is a powerful trading tool that can help traders automate their trading strategies. With its risk-based lot size calculation and predefined take profit and stop loss levels, it aims to provide a systematic and disciplined approach to trading. 

This code provides a basic implementation of Blitz MT5's trading strategy. It uses the current account balance, risk percentage, take profit, and stop loss parameters to calculate the appropriate lot size for each trade. It then determines the entry and exit points based on the current market conditions.

The EA checks for an existing open position and opens a buy position if there are no open positions. It sets the stop loss and take profit levels based on the calculated values. If there is an existing position, it checks if the position meets the take profit or stop loss conditions and closes the position accordingly.

Please note that this code is a sample implementation of Blitz MT5's trading strategy. It is not the official code provided by the developers.
